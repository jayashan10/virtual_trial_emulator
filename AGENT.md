## Task
1. Review our Simulation of clinical trials product

3. Understand how we did it

4. Find open source data set of real world clinical trials with verified real results which were achieved by life scientists in the past 

5. Use the input data for the past clinical trials (the same life scientists used for their research) and simulate these clinical trials

6. Compare your simulated outcome with real world outcomes (past outcomes).

So, what we have done till now is choose the dataset. So we have chosen the one here at :
